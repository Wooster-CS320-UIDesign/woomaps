Welcome to the College of Wooster. Hope you had a great experience in the college. In case you are not familiar with our campus layout, we introduce you the WooMaps app. Using this application, you will be able to look around all our buildings. Also, it will help you identify which are the dining buildings, which are the libraries, and which are the academic buildings.
