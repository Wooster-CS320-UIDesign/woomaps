# WooMaps
WooMaps was created to help students and guests at the College of Wooster navigate what can sometimes be a confusing campus. WooMaps allows users to explore academic buildings, libraries, and dining halls on campus. There is a navigation option to help find your way from place to place on campus. Other features include additional information on buildings, photos to help guide the way, and language options.
